# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game (C++ Console Application)

Welcome to *Tic Tac Toe*, a simple and fun console-based game built using the C++ programming language. This project is a great starting point for beginners who want to understand core programming concepts and practice building an interactive application in C++.

## 📌 Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

This project was built to practice:
- 2D arrays and loops
- Input validation and control flow
- Game logic implementation
- Turn-based interaction in the terminal
